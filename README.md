## Anatta Project


Built with VueJs.

The mock ups only show the smallest mobile layout, and the max width desktop layout,
so I tried to bridge those as best I could - considering what I had to go on - and I straddled
the line between 'quality built' and speed.

I mainly focused on the two sizes provided, so the sizes in between are responsive only in
the barest sense. Additionally, there was A LOT to build with this, so I had to economize my
time where possible and skip a few components in favor of explicit directives laid out in the PDF,
(add to cart, specifically). Otherwise, I did my best to get pixel perfect on the layouts.

There were also several icons that needed to be taken from the mocks, so there was time spen
doing that.

Everything is mostly modular, however, I had to try and focus on what I knew was being asked
of me, so there are several hard coded pieces of text throughout, as well as the SVG stand-ins
I created for the more complicated and time consuming aspects of the design.  

Also, the images were not exactly the same as the design note for note, so keep that in mind.
The image dimensions were generally opposite of the mockup.
