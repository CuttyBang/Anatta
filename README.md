## Anatta Project


Built with VueJs.

The mock ups only show the smallest mobile layout, and the max width desktop layout,
so I tried to bridge those as best I could - straddling the line between intuitive solution and speed.

I mainly focused on the two sizes provided, so the sizes in between are responsive only in the barest sense. 

Additionally, there was A LOT to build with this, so I chose to economize my time where possible. I did so by focusing on the 
more explicit directives laid out in the PDF, and creating SVG stand-is for the more complicated and time consuming aspects of 
the design that were not feasible to build from scratch. 

Everything is modular and component based, with certain portions of text being hardcoded, since that seemed to make the most 
sense. 

There were also several icons that needed to be taken from the mocks, as the icons from FontAwesome either did not match, or 
simply are not available. So in order to faithfully re-create the mockup, I opted to create an SVG sprite for the icons I was 
unable to find elsewise.
